## Learning to Program!!
Hello netizens!!
Inked here and I'm new to coding and programming languages but am very interested in learning.
I'm currently doing research at an academic institution on vaccines for HIV and will be applying for a Master's in a Bioinformatics program in January, 2024. This is the reason for all my work in coding hence forth. I Hope to build an extremely professional and useful professional Github going forward that will show my strengths and apptitudes in both software and data engineering. Hopefully this will also allow me to get into some good networking and programming collaborations along the way.
